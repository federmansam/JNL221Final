    <p><strong>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</strong> — It’s a feeling that every driver has felt at the end of a stressful journey. Sitting behind the wheel, defeated, exhausted, and just ready to get on with your day. After all, driving is – for most – a means to an end, and once you can sense that end, there’s nothing worse than something keeping you from it.</p>

    <p>But you still circle the block, time and time again searching for a parking space, and there’s nothing there. In the event that you do see a space, you’re not even sure if you’re allowed to park there, because how could there possibly be an open space?</p>

    <p>And around Syracuse University, if you don’t have a permit to park in one of the SU-owned lots or garages, this is a familiar experience. The only thing that could possibly make it worse is coming back to your car and being greeted by a white piece of paper tucked beneath your windshield wipers for one reason or another.</p>

    <p>The dreaded parking ticket.</p>

    <p>But taking a deeper dive into the data surrounding parking tickets in Syracuse, one trend becomes clear. The area surrounding SU contains some of the most ticketed blocks and locations in the city. In fact, from Jan. 2023 to mid-Dec. 2024, five of the top eight, four of the top six, and both of the top two most ticketed locations in Syracuse were right near the University. Obviously, that’s impacted by SU being a high-volume traffic location, but there are also a plethora of other reasons why these locations in particular are so highly-ticketed, from strange parking rules, to the very way that parking tickets are given out in the city these days.</p>

    <p>300 Waverly Ave. is right outside the former Marion Hall, a great parking spot for somebody going to the main part of SU's campus. And that is reflected in the ridiculous amount of parking tickets given out there. Overtime parking is the most common reason for a ticket in this stretch of road, but plenty of tickets were given out for obstructing traffic, or parking in a no parking zone.</p>

    <p>Since it’s a major street for traffic in the area, you have to be careful to not disturb the flow.</p>

    <p>“Generally speaking, if there’s a high level of parking enforcement,” Sergeant Thomas Blake, the Public Information Officer for the Syracuse Police Department, said. “It’s because people are calling into 911. The areas where we’re writing the most parking tickets are correlational with the number of complaints we are receiving in that particular area.”</p>

    <p> Unsurprisingly, when the semester ends, far fewer parking tickets are given out in this location, also likely correlating with a smaller amount of complaints, a smaller volume of parking, and less flow of traffic to be disturbed.</p>

    <p>Parking complaints don’t just come from people looking around for violators to report, Blake says that the department receives plenty of calls from people who can’t get out of their driveway, their parking space, or can’t move anywhere because of the way people are parked.</p>

    <p>Despite this, Syracuse’s most common ticket is given for a rule that many may not understand completely. Even Blake would admit that it “seems kind of arbitrary,” but the Odd/Even parking rule is crucial to street function in the city.</p>

    <p>On certain days and at certain times on certain streets (marked with a sign), drivers can only park on the side of the road with the even street addresses, while at other times, drivers can only park on the odd side.</p>

    <p>It’s responsible for nearly 29% of the city’s parking tickets within the sample, just nicking out overtime parking.</p>

    <p>“If people are parked on both sides of the street,” Blake said. “A lot of times that restricts traffic flow. Certainly larger vehicles, like fire trucks, ambulances, and so on will have difficulty navigating it. We have a lot of snow plow activity, so for the winter months, the reason why it’s done is so that the snow plow can effectively clear out the streets. And then in the summer months, we have our sanitation department that goes out with street sweepers and they clean the roads as well.”</p>

    <p>The area with the most Odd/Even parking violations is – you guessed it – around Syracuse University. Walnut Avenue and Walnut Place are parallel one-way streets that use the odd/even parking rule near Bird Library, Watson Hall, the Schine Student Center, and other major SU locations. Each of the four most ticketed blocks for Odd/Even parking are within this stretch, with just those top four accounting for over 10% of all Odd/Even tickets in the city.</p>

</script>
</div>

    <p>This statistic surprised Blake, who expected that the Tipperary Hill neighborhood would have a ton of Odd/Even parking tickets, but he’s not surprised that the University is a hub of parking violations in general.</p>

    <p>“A lot of college students live in multi-occupancy buildings,” he said. “A lot of them have cars, and there’s only so much off-the-street parking, so they rely on the street parking, probably more than most other places. And college kids are busy, they’re running from class to class or whatever.”</p>

    <p>One way for drivers to know where to park is to visit <a href="https://www.syr.gov/Departments/PVB" target="_blank">syr.gov/departments/PVB</a>, the city's official parking website. Blake also suggested that DPS could find a way to make students more aware of the parking rules, and help direct students to the website.</p>

    <p>While an important function, parking violations are not exactly at the top of the priority list for the city. Blake adds that Syracuse no longer has as many police officers writing tickets, with many tickets being written electronically using a machine that was just rolled out to officers within the last year. The city also has community service officers, who handle low-level law enforcement functions, and parking checkers, civilians who go around writing tickets, who aid in this process.</p>

    <p>“We just don’t have the numbers that we used to have,” Blake said. “And there’s a lot of other stuff going on.”</p>
